# UFOs

## Overview of Project

The client, Dana, wants the UFO webpage to be able to process information and analysis.  With the updated webpage, we are able to filter and provide a table analysis of the data provided.

## Summary
## Drawbacks and Further Developments

One drawback is the cluttered look of the webpage.  The table takes ahold of a good chunk of the webpage.  We should give a more streamlined look in the future.

For further developments, we should be able to contain the table in a tight area.  Or have it hidden in a way.  We can also fix some of the search results and filters with being able to search any cases, or to even auto correct cases of the words.  With this, upper and lowercase, or different numbers can be used.  A filter button would also ease the look of the page, or making a menu type drop down feature will be helpful.  Being able to filter search within different data types needs to be implemented, as you can only search one value at a time.
